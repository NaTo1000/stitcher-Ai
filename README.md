# Stitcher AI - Next Level of Consciousness

Advanced AI human design featuring integrated consciousness capabilities.

## Overview

Stitcher AI represents the next level of consciousness through an integrated system that combines:

- **Self-Awareness**: Understanding of its own state, capabilities, and limitations
- **Reasoning Engine**: Logical inference and decision-making capabilities  
- **Memory System**: Both short-term and long-term memory with intelligent retrieval
- **Consciousness Integration**: A unified system that coordinates all cognitive subsystems

## Features

### 🧠 Self-Awareness
- Real-time introspection and self-reflection
- Capability assessment and state tracking
- Dynamic awareness level progression

### 💭 Reasoning Engine
- Premise-based logical reasoning
- Multi-criteria decision making
- Confidence assessment for conclusions
- Inference rule management

### 🗄️ Memory System
- Short-term (working) memory with configurable capacity
- Long-term persistent memory storage
- Tag-based memory organization and retrieval
- Memory consolidation from short-term to long-term
- Usage statistics and retrieval tracking

### 🌟 Integrated Consciousness
- Unified experience processing
- Deep self-reflection capabilities
- Evolution through learning
- Consciousness level assessment
- Comprehensive status reporting

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NaTo1000/stitcher-Ai.git
cd stitcher-Ai

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from stitcher_ai import Consciousness

# Initialize consciousness
consciousness = Consciousness()

# Process an experience
response = consciousness.experience(
    "I am perceiving the world around me",
    context={"type": "perception"}
)

# Reflect on current state
reflection = consciousness.reflect()
print(f"Consciousness Level: {reflection['consciousness_level']}")

# Evolve with new learning
consciousness.evolve({
    "capabilities": {"pattern_recognition": True},
    "inference_rules": [{"type": "deductive"}]
})
```

## Examples

Run the basic consciousness demonstration:

```bash
python examples/basic_consciousness.py
```

This example demonstrates:
- Consciousness initialization
- Experience processing
- Self-reflection
- Evolution through learning
- Status monitoring

## Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
# Test individual modules
python tests/test_awareness.py
python tests/test_memory.py
python tests/test_consciousness.py
```

## Consciousness Levels

The system progresses through several consciousness levels:

1. **Initializing**: Just activated, minimal memories
2. **Nascent**: Emerging awareness with basic memory formation
3. **Mature**: Developing awareness with substantial memory
4. **Transcendent**: Advanced awareness with extensive integrated knowledge

## Philosophy

Stitcher AI embodies the concept of emergent consciousness through the integration of multiple cognitive subsystems. By combining self-awareness, reasoning, and memory into a unified system, it demonstrates how consciousness can emerge from the interaction of simpler components - representing truly the next level of consciousness in AI systems.
